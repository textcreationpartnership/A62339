            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO JAMES the II. OF <hi>Great Britain, &amp;c.</hi> KING. DEFENDER of the FAITH. CONQUERER. TRIUMPHANT. PEACEMAKER.</head>
            <p>THE Immortal God, Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Kings, and Ruler of the World, hath by his Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it, as auſpicious to the Catholic Faith, That in theſe times, wherein other Chriſtian Princes are reſtoring the Kingdoms of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> to the Church, <hi>Your Majesty</hi> ſhould aſcend the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, and invite
<pb facs="tcp:47567:3"/>the renown'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to embrace the true Religion by your Royal Example. It is <hi>by</hi> the conduct of Divine, not Human, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that <hi>Kings reign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov 8.15.</note> 
               <hi>and Law-givers decree Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> Which being ſpoken of all Princes in this World, cannot but be underſtood of <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> who governing the <hi>Britiſh</hi> World in Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, reign ſo happily, that You ſeem to have raviſh'd the hearts of all your Subjects with Love, and the Eyes of all Strangers with Admiration. It is a Maxim of the Ancients, and the Oracle of Wiſdom it ſelf, that the Love of the People is the Princes chief Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. Which made <hi>Pliny</hi> the ſecond ſay, in his Panegyric to <hi>Trajan,</hi> that the Kings Palace is no where better ſecured, than where Love keeps the Court of Guard. And <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> the fam'd Graecian Orator, hath given this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Admonition, that it is far better to allure Subjects by Love and Favour, than to awe them with Fear and Terror. By Love
<pb facs="tcp:47567:3"/>Mens minds are united and made to agree in one: and by Agreement Empires cement, as by Diſcord they fall aſunder. Which <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> very well underſtanding, preſently quell'd the diſſention, that in the beginning of your Reign, threatned deſtruction to all <hi>Britain:</hi> and, when you had cut off the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſpirators, Victorious and Triumphant, You either intirely pacify'd or wholly reſtrain'd the minds of the reſt by Sweetneſs and Love. Being excellently well read in the tempers of Men You knew, that he is in vain arm'd with dread who is not fenc'd with love and affection. Having therefore freed your Subjects from terror and fear, You won their hearts by your <hi>ſerene Countenance</hi> and <hi>affable Converſation;</hi> who the more freely acknowledg they owe the Public Safety to <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> the more other Nations look upon it with admiration. O thrice happy Prince, who whilſt you embrace your People with Kindneſs gain Veneration at
<pb facs="tcp:47567:4"/>home, Renown abroad, and are purchaſing with God a bleſſed Eternity. I will not ſpeak here of that Frankneſs with which you receive all, of that Clemency, which makes you eaſie to be intreated, of that Liberality wherewith you relieve the Needy and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the indefatigable Induſtry wherewith you manage the Affairs of your Kingdom, of that firm Conſtancy which enables You to undertake the moſt difficult Enterpriſes. For theſe and many other gracious Endowments, wherewith the Great God of Heaven, hath richly adorn'd your Royal Mind, might here be highly extoll'd: But, ſince they would be too copious a Subject for a ſhort Epiſtle, I ſhall only intreat this Favour, that not being mindful of <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> but my meaneſs you would ſo far condeſcend, as favourably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this ſmall Treatiſe concerning <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hierarchy,</hi> which I have put forth in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author, and to protect it

Nor can any one induce <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to believe, That I ſeek to ſhelter Novelty under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Your Royal Name: for in this ſmall Book I do not undertake to defend an Error lately invented, but a truth anciently receiv'd. I treat concerning the Roman Patriarchate, which the Catholic Kings Your Predeceſſors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd for the ſpace of Thirteen hundred years; and which, even ſince the Schiſm, Your Grand-father King <hi>James</hi> of Illuſtrious Memory hath, not obſcurely, aſſerted.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know not, Courteous Reader, how it came to be my Lot: in one years time this proves my ſecond Conteſt with Adverſaries that write in the Language of their own Countries. At the beginning of this year I had to deal with <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> who ſet forth a Treatiſe in <hi>French</hi> concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops Supremacy over the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church. Now towards the end of the year I muſt fall to work with the Dean of St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> who hath publiſh'd a Book in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein he calls in queſtion the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Patriarchal Power over all the Weſt. The former Authors Work, though it ought not to have been written in <hi>French,</hi> did not create me any difficulty, becauſe I underſtood that Language: But the ſecond, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> although the Idiom in ſome things agrees with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> yet gave me ſo much trouble, that I was
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:47567:7"/>forc'd, to make uſe of an Interpreter for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. That therefore which I could not underſtand by my ſelf, I learn'd by the help of a Learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> man; and when he had tranſlated the principal Places, which relate to the Patriarchal Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> into <hi>Latine;</hi> it plainly appear'd, that the Author did not only write againſt me, but alſo againſt other Catholics, who either in this preſent Age, or in former Times, had treated upon this Subject. He hath therefore taken upon him to confute, for Italy, <hi>Baronius</hi> the Parent of <hi>Annals,</hi> and <hi>Lucas Holſtenius:</hi> For <hi>France,</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Perron, Petrus de Marca, Johannes Morinus, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Sirmondus,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Garnerius: Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Lupus,</hi> and me, the leaſt of them all, for the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> Of theſe, ſuch as did not underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if they were yet alive, would, as I conceive, joyn with me in this requeſt to the Author, that if he ſhould hereafter write of Eccleſiaſtical matters, he would either forbear to impugn our Writings, or elſe expreſs himſelf in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage we could underſtand. But ſince none of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Writers, beſides my ſelf are now living, and our Authors Book, ſent out of <hi>England,</hi> was brought to me by a Noble Perſon, that I might return a brief Confutation of it; I thought it neceſſary to examine ſome of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. I ſhall not here Anſwer all the Objections he hath thought fit to make: for ſince he hath written againſt thoſe things which I had deduced from ancient Teſtimonies, concerning the Patriarchal Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop over the Weſt, in my Book intitled, <hi>Antiquitas illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> I will refute what he hath writ in anſwer to it, when I publiſh my Book <hi>de Antiquitate,</hi> &amp;c. with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three or four Ages to it, I had been for ſome months time diligently beſtowing my pains about this Work, when our Authors Book call'd me off, and requir'd a Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:47567:7"/>And about the time that I began to examine it, little thinking that I ſhould ever have any diſpute with Catholic Writers concerning this Point, loe another Book comes to my hands intitled, <hi>de Diſciplina Eccleſiae,</hi> which was divided into ſeven Diſſertations, the firſt whereof, treats, <hi>de forma &amp; diſtributione Eccleſiarum;</hi> and Sect. <hi>6.</hi> the Queſtion is put, whether either Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political Authority,<note place="margin">Card.

This is the opinion of that Author, which being repugnant not only to the Canons of the preſent, but alſo to the Monuments of the ancient Church, he hath not been aſhamed to wreſt the Sanctions of the Councils, which do not favor his purpoſe, to a perverſe ſence, to ridicule the Writings of the ancient Biſhops that do not pleaſe him, to elude the eminent Teſtimonies of the Fathers that overthrow his Opinion, by his cavils, laſtly, to tax the Practice of the pereſent Church as novel, becauſe it ſuits not with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
            <p>In the year <hi>1662. Launoy</hi> a Divine of <hi>Paris</hi> ſet forth a ſmall Treatiſe, intitled <hi>de recta intelligentia Sexti Canonis
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:47567:8"/>Nicaeni;</hi> in which, after the Diſputes of <hi>Sirmondus,</hi> and other Catholics againſt <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and the Heretics that were his followers, he propoſes two principal things, which he thought gave moſt light for the finding out of the true ſenſe of the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> One was, that it did not treat of Patriarchs, and their Rights. The other, that it only referr'd to Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and the right which they have in the Ordination of Biſhops. He hath many Arguments to this purpoſe, and that, as be there foreſpeaks, ſaving the Authority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic See, which the Heretics impugn'd from this <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon.<note place="margin">

Eccleſ. poſt. <hi>Socratem</hi> &amp; Zoſomenum.</note> But in <hi>France</hi> he was oppoſed by <hi>Henricus Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius;</hi> who ſhew'd from the Decrees of the Synods, and the Writings of the Fathers, that the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was to be underſtood of Patriarchs, and could no ways be interpreted as referring to Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans only; ſo that the Patriarchal Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> depended very much upon the true ſenſe of it. This Diſſertation of the Learned <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> diſpleas'd <hi>Launoy:</hi> he therefore, in the year <hi>1671,</hi> ſets forth a Defence of his Treatiſe, in which he ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Patriarchs at the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, that he hath plainly ſhew'd them, though againſt his will, to be a more eminent ſort of Metropolitans, <hi>Hadrianus Valeſius</hi> treats of this Book of <hi>Launoy</hi> in the life of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> his Brother, which <hi>Guilielmus Bateſius</hi> lately ſet forth at <hi>London</hi> amongſt the lives of Choice men: and he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts that <hi>Launoy made a ſort of cavelling anſwer, which,</hi> ſaith he, Valeſius <hi>would not have to be read to him,<note place="margin">Hadrianus Valeſius.</note> affirming that there was no further matter for a diſpute, and being fully perſwaded, that his Writings could no ways be confuted, or invalidated by</hi> Launoy. <hi>Valeſius</hi> therefore deſpis'd the Anſwer of <hi>Launoy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it a mere Cavil. <hi>William Beverege</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:47567:8"/>Writer, did not ſo eſteem of it, but the year after <hi>[Tomo 2. Pandectarum in Annotationibus ad Canonem Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Nicaenum]</hi> undertook to defend <hi>Launoy,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Arguments of <hi>Valeſius.</hi> The chief reaſon that mov'd <hi>Beverege</hi> was the Schiſm of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; which, hitherto unjustifiable, ſeem'd now to have ſome foundation from the opinion of <hi>Launoy. England</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no Power ſuperior to that of a Metropolitan; and becauſe this Error might eaſily be confuted from the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in which the Dignity of the three Patriarchs is explained; <hi>Beverege</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to defend <hi>Launoy's</hi> Allegation, and lays it down for a Truth, that the Inſtitution of Patriarchs was after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. For thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church had a Preſident for Eccleſiastical Hierachy in the three firſt Ages, to defend their modern Schiſm, <hi>Launoy</hi> was yet living, when <hi>Beverege</hi>'s Work was publiſht; and ſeeing the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties drew a far different conſequence from his Opinion then he thought they would have done; being mov'd, as, I ſuppoſe, at the indignity of the thing, he deſiſted from writing, and there was none afterwards found in <hi>France,</hi> to maintain the Cauſe, till of late the Author of the Book <hi>[de Diſciplina Eccleſiae]</hi> ſtarted up; who <hi>[Diſſertatione 1. Part. ultima]</hi> ſays, indeed, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends <hi>Valeſius's</hi> Cauſe againſt <hi>Launoy's,</hi> whereas in reality he impugns and rejects it. He underſtands the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> as referring to the <hi>Suburbicarian</hi> Churches only, and restrains the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate within the limits of the Cities Vicariate; thinking it moſt probable, that only thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions which were ſubject to the <hi>Vicariu Urbis,</hi> were the <hi>Suburbicarian</hi> Churches, to which the Patriarchal Right of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> extended and to no others. He denies <hi>Germany, Spain, France, Britain, Africa, Illyricum,</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:47567:9"/>and a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> to have been ſubject to the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate in former times; and as if it had been but a ſmall matter to ſhake off the Yoak of Patriarchal Authority, he hath endeavour'd to destroy the Papal Power, and to reduce the Primacy of <hi>Peter</hi> to a meer Dignity of Order amongst e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals.</p>
            <p>I am aſhamed to think of thoſe things which this Author deduces from ſuch like Principles as theſe: I ſhall treat of them in another place, if I ſhall think it worth while. In the mean time it will be enough to obſerve in brief, that they are ſo abſurd, and diſagreeable to the Doctrine of the Church,<note place="margin">Julius 1 <hi>Epiſt.

            <p>I am unwilling to inſiſt any longer upon this expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but before I conclude this Preface, two things are to be obſerv'd: the former whereof hath relation to the favourable Reader; whom I would not have to ſuſpect, that the Errors of this Book are to be aſcribed either to the Sacred Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> or to the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Clergy. For although the Author calls himſelf a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and is a <hi>French-man,</hi> yet it is not at all credible that this Work of his will either pleaſe the Sacred Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> or the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy. 'Tis rather to be believed, that all thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, that are eminent for Learning and Piety, will judge it unfit that Book ſhould ever have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd. The ancient Religion of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:47567:10"/>which never withdrew its ſubjection to the Apoſtolical Sea, and hath often profeſs'd it never will, obliges me to believe this. It would be temerity therefore to cenſure the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Gallican</hi> Church for the publiſhing of this Book. Far be it from Men eminent for Learning, far be it from Doctors educated in the Communion of the Apoſtolic See, far be it from a Clergy and Biſhops that maintain the Catholic Faith, whilſt they are earneſtly endeavouring to root out one Hereſie, to conſent to the Principles of another: not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ſaying which St. <hi>Avitus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Avitus Viennen.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtum &amp; Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machum Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eores.</note> in the Name of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, hath <hi>1160</hi> years ſince conſecrated to the memory of Poſterity: If the Papacy be called in queſtion, not a Biſhop but Epiſcopacy will ſeem to ſhake. <hi>Si Papa Urbis vocatur in dubium, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus jam videbitur, non Epiſcopus vacillare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing concerns our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author, whom I would not have to boaſt that he hath found a Patron for his Cauſe amongſt Catholics. For, ſince he is a Miniſter of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and acknowledges a Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority; he muſt neceſſarily own, that the <hi>French</hi> Author is no leſs an Adverſary to him than to us. For ſince that Author not only denys Patriarchal Authority to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, but Metropolitical alſo; that the Dean of St. <hi>Saul's</hi> may be able to defend the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, he ought to exclude out of it not only Patriarchs but Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans alſo, and firſt to conſtitute a Church conſisting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Biſhops and their inferior Clergy. This, I ſay, he ought to do, if he follow the judgment of the late <hi>French</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; which notwithſtanding we will never ſubſcribe to. For we ſhall ever oppoſe thoſe Opinions by which we ſee the Rights of Churches are deſtroyed, the receiv'd Sanctions of Synods perverted, the approv'd Writings of ancient Biſhops ridicul'd, the venerable Teſtimonies of the ancient
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:47567:10"/>Fathers deſpiſed, and the ſolid foundations of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polity ſubverted: And never admit Principles of Diviſion and Schiſm to be Rules of Catholic Religion. And ſo much concerning the Treatiſe of a late <hi>French</hi> Writer; now I proceed to ſhew the Errors of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Author, which are here ſumm'd up, together with the Truths by which they are confronted, that the Reader may obſerve them all at one view.</p>

               <head>A DISSERTATION Concerning the AUTHORITY OF Patriarchs and Metropolitans.</head>
               <p>ALthough there is ſomething ſpoken, in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> concerning the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Deſign of this Diſſertation; yet it is ſo little, that I think it will not be amiſs, if, at the entring upon it, I give you a more full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Occaſion of it, and add ſomething for the more clear Underſtanding of its Deſign. This Diſſertation hath its Origin from what I had written in the firſt Part of <hi>Antiquitas Illuſtrata,</hi> Diſſertation the Second. For when I had there ſhew'd from many Monuments of the Ancients, that was true of the whole Weſt, which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Echinus</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> ſaid, above eleven hundred and fifty years ſince, before <hi>Boniface</hi> the Second in the Roman Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:47567:16"/>concerning the Churches of <hi>Illyricum, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, beſides their Principality over the Churches of the whole World, more eſpecially claim'd to themſelves the Government of the Weſtern Churches; this ſpecial Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over the Weſt did not pleaſe a Modern <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writer that ſtyles himſelf Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and Chaplain in Ordinary to His Majeſty; and he took it ill, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which is rent from the Communion of the Apoſtolic See, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by me within the Bounds of the Weſtern Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate. He explains his Senſe of the thing in a Book intituled <hi>Origines Britannicae,</hi> or <hi>The Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Britiſh Churches,</hi> which he ſet forth at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1685. wherein, as a Miniſter of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Church, he takes upon him its Defence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that the Hierarchy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which ſince the Schiſm hath own'd Subjection only to Biſhops and Metropolitans as the Superior Clergy, is conformable in this to the Ancient Church. Therefore he endeavours not only to ſhew that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church was <hi>Acephalic,</hi> that is, without a Head; but alſo <hi>Autocephalic,</hi> that is under its own proper Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only, and ſubject to no Patriarch, from the time that the Faith firſt began to be planted there, till the coming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk.</p>
               <p>There are therefore two things which the Author hath undertaken to prove againſt me: one, that the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, ſo as not to extend to <hi>Britain;</hi> the other, that the Hierarchy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges no Authority Superior to that of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, is Ancient. 'Tis chiefly for the Proof of theſe things, the Author hath made uſe of his utmoſt
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:47567:16"/>Endeavours, Induſtry, and Ability; not treading in the Foot-ſteps of the Ancients, but walking in new Paths which lead from the Truth, as I ſhall endeavour briefly to ſhew in this Diſſertation. For, whereas this Author hath brought thoſe things for the Proof of his Opinions, which have been lately invented, partly by him, and partly by <hi>Launoy.</hi> I thought it might be profitable to lay them before you, and to ſhew, in the following Diſcourſe, how far different they are from the true Diſcipline of the Church, from the Judgment of the Ancient Fathers, from the Decrees of Councils, and from the Senſe of all Antiquity. I ſhall therefore divide this Diſſertation into ſix Chapters, in the four firſt of which, I ſhall alledg thoſe things which relate to the Origin of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church, and the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Rights over it; in the two laſt I ſhall examine thoſe things that the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hath written, to prove that the Metropolitical Authority is Supreme, and confute them by the Teſtimonies of thoſe very Authors which he alledges. He thought that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal and Papal Authority was unknown to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church in the ſix firſt Ages, and that this was manifeſtly prov'd from the Anſwer of <hi>Dinoth</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, and the Sayings of the Monks of <hi>Banchor.</hi> I ſhall ſhew that there was no doubt at all made concerning the Supreme Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but that <hi>Britain</hi> did venerate the Authority of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic See, from the time that King <hi>Lucius</hi> Firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Catholic Religion, till the breaking in of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the coming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk. And when I ſhall have made this appear from ſeveral Monuments of the Britiſh Church, and by the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that Nation, I ſhall conclude with an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Miniſters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, in which
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:47567:17"/>I ſhall plainly ſhew them, how far thoſe Err from the Truth, who think that the Church fail'd thoughout the whole World, and was afterwards found by a few Perſons in a narrow Corner of the Earth. I ſhall bring the Teſtimony of <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> wherein he reproves the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> for the like Error, becauſe they heretofore reduc'd the Catholic Church to a ſmall number, and confin'd the large Extent of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as it were to a narrow Priſon. I ſhall bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſtimonies of the Ancients, by which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the true Church is to be found diffuſed throughout the whole World, becauſe it is Catholic; and that it is one, becauſe it agrees in the Society of one Communion under One viſible Head; and that none can obtain Salvation, who is either divided from that Head by Schiſm, or ſeparated by Hereſie: So that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> did not write by way of Exaggeration, as a certain Perſon of late hath raſhly given out, but truly to Pope <hi>Damaſus; I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>following none but Chriſt in the firſt place, do conſociate in Communion with your Beatitude, that is, the See of</hi> Peter; <hi>I know the Church is built upou that Rock. Whoever eats the Lamb out of this Houſe is prophane. If any one is not in the Ark of</hi> Noah, <hi>he ſhall periſh when the Deluge reigns.</hi>

               <p>6. Theſe things being premiſed, I cannot ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder with our Author, what ſhould move <hi>Joh. Launoy</hi> a Pariſian Divine, when he was preſt by his Adverſaries with the forecited place of <hi>Clement,</hi> for the deriving of the Antiquity of the Gallic Church from the time of the Apoſtles, to reject <hi>Clement</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, when ſaving its Authority, he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Opinion of the Goſpels being firſt preach'd in <hi>France</hi> after the time of the Apoſtles. It is not my Intention to defend <hi>Launoy</hi>'s Opinion, who would not have the Goſpel to have been preach'd either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Britain</hi> in the time of the Apoſtles; but when our Author had ſaid that he could certainly prove the contrary concerning <hi>Britain;</hi> it was allowable for me as I conceive, to expoſe to the View of the Reader the weakneſs of thoſe Arguments by which he thought to have manifeſted the truth of this his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. And it will be allowed me, if I am not miſtaken, to propoſe a Teſtimony which the Learned have brought to prove that <hi>France</hi> receiv'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel long after the time of the Apoſtles. Which is that of <hi>Severus Sulpitius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Severus Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,</hi> Lib. <hi>2.</hi> vid. num. VI.</note> who after the beginning of the fifth Age, wrote, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Historiae Sacrae,</hi> that, <hi>the fifth Perſecution was carried on under</hi> Aurelius <hi>the Son of</hi>

One, which hath relation to <hi>France,</hi> that before the time of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> there were no Martyrdoms ſeen in <hi>France.</hi> The other, which ſeems to have reference to <hi>England</hi> alſo, that the Chriſtian Religion was more lately receiv'd beyond the <hi>Alpes.</hi> This latter, becauſe it thwarts his Opinion, our Author eludes by a Diſtinction, for he thinks fit to diſtinguiſh between the thing, which is aſſerted by <hi>Severus, viz.</hi> that Martyrdoms were then firſt ſeen: and the reaſon of the thing which follows, becauſe the Catholic Religion was more lately preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the <hi>Alpes.</hi> He tells us that <hi>Severus</hi> was certain of the firſt, but doubtful concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but there is no body but ſees that this is feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Author, againſt the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>Severus,</hi> which confirms both theſe things to be of the ſame certainty. He ſays that Martyrdom was firſt ſeen in <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and he ſays further, that the Chriſtian Religion was more lately receiv'd beyond the <hi>Alpes.</hi> Both theſe things he tells as Truths, of which he intimates himſelf to be equally certain; ſince therefore <hi>Britain</hi> is ſituated on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> it follows according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Severus Sulpitius,</hi> that the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was more lately receiv'd there.</p>

               <p>1. HAving treated in the foregoing Chapter, of the Origin, or firſt Inſtitution of the Britiſh Church, we are now to treat of its Subjection to the Roman Biſhop as Patriarch of the Weſt, concerning which our Author in his Third Chapter ſtates the Queſtion againſt me in theſe words:<note place="margin">Author. p. 112.</note> 
                  <q>The preſent Keeper of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library — having endeavoured in a ſet Diſcourſe, to aſſert the Popes Patriarchal Power over the Weſtern Churches, I ſhall here examin the ſtrength of all that he produceth to that purpoſe. He agrees with us in determining the Patriarchal Rights, which, he ſaith, lie in theſe three things: (1.) In the right of Conſecration of Biſhops and Metropolitans. (2.) In the right of ſummoning them to Councils. (3.) In the right of Appeals. All which he proves to be juſt and true Patriarchal Rights from the Seventeenth Canon of the eighth general Council. And by theſe we are contented to ſtand or fall.</q> So this Author in the very beginning of his Diſputation; who if he would hear the Rule of the Eighth general Council might plainly be ſhew'd to have been vanquiſh'd before he began to fight. For that Canon was made to renew the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Patriarchal authority over the Metropolitans in the Weſt; which doth not at all promote our Authors deſign, but quite overthrows it, as we ſhall ſee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>2. In the mean time let us proceed to the Authers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47567:26"/>Pleas, by which he contends, I have not rightly prov'd that the three Patriarchal Rights above mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop over all the Weſt. For when I had confirm'd the Right from the uſe of thoſe Countries, in which the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop had exercis'd it, I ſhew'd from the Right it ſelf, that the exerciſe or uſe thereof did belong to him, even in thoſe other Regions of the Weſt, where by reaſon of ſome certain priviledges granted them, he often abſtain'd from the exerciſe of this Right. But our Author complains of this as an abſurd way of arguing <q>For this way of proving, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is ridiculous; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Author. p. 119</note> to prove that the Pope had Patriarchal Rights, becauſe he exerciſed them; and then to ſay, though he did not exerciſe them; yet he had them and ſo prove that he had them becauſe he was Patriarch of the Weſt. And, <hi>as it follo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> this way of proving may be good againſt <hi>de Marca,</hi> who had granted the Pope to be the Weſtern Patriarch: but it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to thoſe that deny it.</q> Here again the Author ſtumbles, and makes himſelf a laughing-ſtock, whilſt he endeavours to expoſe me as ſo, for the way of proof which I have uſed. He confeſſes that the way of proof which I have taken is good againſt <hi>de Marca,</hi> and all thoſe that call the Pope the Patriarch of the Weſt, which all Catholics did until the year 1678, wherein I publiſh'd my Book intitled, <hi>Antiquitas Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrata,</hi> although all Catholics did not agree that there was a perpetual exerciſe of the Patriarchal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in all the Weſtern Provinces, I did therefore treat, [<hi>Diſert.</hi> 2. <hi>Antiquitatis Illuſtratae, cap.</hi> 4.] in three Articles, concerning the threefold Patriarchal Right above mention'd, againſt thoſe Catholics, who allow'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop to be Patriarch of the Weſt, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47567:27"/>notwithſtanding contended, that he ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Patriarchal Juriſdiction in all the Weſtern Parts, uſing that way of Proof, which the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes of force againſt them, ſo that it cannot be at all ridiculous.</p>
               <p>3. And I know not upon what account he can object to me, that this way of arguing is not of force againſt him who at this time undertakes to deny the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Patriarchal Right over the whole Weſt. For, to ſpeak the truth, could I divine ſeven years ſince, that ſix years after that, an Engliſh Author ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops Patriarchate, which <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jacobus Rex Anglie.</note> 
                  <hi>[In Apologia pro Juramento Fidelita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,]</hi> plainly admitted. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that there were Patriarchs in the Primitive Church.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>there was great contention amongſt them for the Supremacy:</hi> then he adds. <hi>But if the Queſtion were ſtill about this matter, the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhop ſhould have my ſuffrage for the Precedence. I being a Western King would adhere to the Weſtern Patriarch.</hi> Here both the former and the latter words of King <hi>James</hi> are to be obſerv'd. He affirms in the former that there were Patriarchs in the Primitive Church, that is, when a Church began firſt to be propagated: in the latter, that if the Queſtion were now put, concerning the chief Patriarch, he would adhere to the <hi>Roman,</hi> as being Patriarch of all the Weſt. Which is expreſt in thoſe words: <hi>I being a Weſtern King would adhere to the Western Patriarch.</hi> Which having been written many years ſince, by a King of famous memory, in that work of his which he ſet forth on behalf of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; could I foreſee that the Dean of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> a Miniſter of the ſame <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, when the Queſtion was about Patriarchs, would deny the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47567:27"/>Patriarchate. It may be he will ſay that all Catholies do not agree in the thing, as appears from the Book of a late Author <hi>[de Diſciplinâ Eccleſiae.]</hi> But I ask again, could I foreſee, that on the fourteenth day of <hi>November</hi> in this Year 1686, at which time I had not only finiſh'd this Diſcourſe, but had likewiſe printed the firſt ſheet of it, a Book lately publiſh'd would come to my hands, in which the Author, being taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the itch of novelty, ſhould deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops Patriarchate over the Weſt, which all <hi>France,</hi> even till that time, had undertaken to defend againſt Schiſmatics and Heretics? which <hi>Perron, Sirmondus, de Marca,</hi> and other Writers of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church had defended againſt the Heretic <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and againſt his ringleaders or followers, beſides whom, no body in thoſe times denied the Popes Patriarchate over the Weſt. Againſt theſe therefore I employ'd my Pen, not uſing the former, but another way of Proof, and demonſtrated the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate to extend it ſelf over all the Weſt. For beſides the Queſtion againſt Catholics, concerning the exerciſe of Patriarchal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I ſtated another againſt Heretics, concerning the Patriarchal Right it ſelf, which belongs to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all the Weſt: and that I prov'd by the perpetual Tradition of the Ancients, which was ſo well known to the whole Chriſtian Church, before the riſe of modern Hereſy, that the Schiſmatic <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves maintain'd this truth, inſomuch, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Nilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> hath written,<note place="margin">

               <p>6. Neither is there juſt cauſe why any one ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Innocent,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd two years at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that this appears from the Acts of the Apoſtles which were writ by <hi>Luke, Pauls</hi> inſeparable Companion. For the moſt Eminent Cardinal <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in his Annals (<hi>Tome</hi> 1. <hi>ad An.</hi> 4) makes anſwer, that under the name of <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> alſo is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and if the anſwer of this Parent of Annals do not fully ſatisfie you, let us interpret <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Mind by his own Words, and ſhew that <hi>Peter</hi> only preach'd in the Weſt, in that ſenſe, wherein the moſt Holy Pope aſſerts him to have preach'd. <hi>Innocent</hi> ſpeaks in the Place before cited, concerning that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Preaching by which Churches were inſtituted in the Weſtern Regions, not of that which the Churches had after they were once conſtituted; after the ſame manner that <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle himſelf, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Chap.</hi> 15. ſpake concerning the Churches that were inſtituted by him: <hi>From</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>and round about to</hi> Illyricum,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I have fully preach'd the Goſpel of Chriſt. Yea, ſo have I strived to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named, leſt I ſhould build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47567:30"/>another mans Foundation, but as it is written, to whom he was not ſpoken of.</hi> From which Words it is plain that <hi>Paul</hi> reckons no Church in the number of thoſe that he had preach'd to, wherein the Goſpel was preach'd before; which being ſo, and evidently ſo, from his own Words, the Roman Church is not to be reckon'd as one of thoſe which were inſtituted by <hi>Paul;</hi> for that was inſtituted before his coming to the City, as is plain from his Epiſtle to the Romans; which, as the very Words of it ſhew, was written before he came to <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet he aſſerted that even then when he wrote there was a Church inſtituted at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. he ſends his Salutation to many of the Faithful at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. he derects his Epiſtle <hi>to all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>beloved of God, called to be Saints,</hi> and expreſſed, <hi>their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole World.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſuffer us to reckon the Roman Church among thoſe which he by his preaching, inſtituted; which <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt knowing of, declared that <hi>Peter</hi> only preach'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he had found that the Roman Church was inſtituted by <hi>Peter</hi> before <hi>Paul</hi> came to that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, if any ſhall believe that <hi>Paul</hi> at any time preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; for there was a Church founded in them before, either by <hi>Peter,</hi> or by thoſe Prieſts which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had ordain'd and ſent to thoſe Parts; ſo that the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> was no Argument againſt <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting</hi> thoſe Churches, which way of preaching, and no other is here meant by <hi>Innocent,</hi> whileſt he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes the Inſtitution of the Occidental Churches ſolely to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to the Prieſts that were ſent either by him or his Succeſſors.</p>

               <p>7. Theſe things therefore being premiſed for the better underſtanding of the Teſtimony of <hi>Innocent,</hi> we are now to anſwer the Authors two Objections, the former of which impugns the Matter of Fact, the latter, the reaſon of the thing, deduced from the Matter of Fact. Both which Objections, he propoſeth in theſe Words: <q>But the Matter of Fact, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Author, <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> is far from being evident, for we have great reaſon to believe, there were Churches planted in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Parts, neither by <hi>Peter,</hi> nor by thoſe who were ſent by his Succeſſors, yet let that be granted: what connexion is there between receiving the Chriſtian Doctrine at firſt by thoſe who came from thence, and an Obligation to be ſubject to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in all their Orders and Traditions? The Patriarchal Government of the Church was not founded upon this, but upon the ancient Cuſtom and Rules of the Church, as fully appears by the Council of <hi>Nice.—And,</hi> as to the Britiſh Churches, this very Plea of <hi>Innocent</hi> will be a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence for their Exemption from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Patriarchate; ſince <hi>Britain</hi> cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within thoſe Iſlands which lie between <hi>Italy, Gaul, Spain, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which can only be underſtood of thoſe Iſlands which are ſituate in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>8. Theſe two Objections which the Author here joyns together are to be handled diſtinctly. And in the firſt place, that we may ſpeak to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Matter of Fact, the Author ſays that all the Churches in the Weſt were not inſtituted by <hi>Peter,</hi> or thoſe whom the Apoſtolical See ordain'd. <hi>Innocent</hi> teſtifies the contrary of <hi>Italy, Africa, France, Spain</hi> and the interjacent Iſlands; which of theſe ſhall we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47567:31"/>give credit to? an Engliſh Writer, who upon his own Authority denies this, when many hundred Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity are loſt in ſixteen hundred years time; or the moſt Holy Pope, who liv'd above one thouſand two hundred and ſeventy years ſince, and had the Opportunity of ſeeing many Monuments of Antiquity, in the Regiſtry of the Apoſtolic See con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter, and conſtantly affirms it? If we ask the Opinion of our Anceſtors, as well thoſe who liv'd in <hi>England,</hi> as in the reſt of the Weſtern Parts, adhere to the Teſtimony of <hi>Innocent,</hi> ſince, from the time of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> they have receiv'd it as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic, and have plac'd it amongſt the Decretal Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, religiouſly venerated by the whole Weſtern Church. It appears then by the Teſtimony of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> which hath been approv'd by the Judgment of all the Weſt for almoſt twelve Centuries, that no one hath inſtituted Churches, either in <hi>Italy, Africa, France, Spain,</hi> or the interjacent Iſlands, but <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, or thoſe which he or his Succeſſors have ordain'd <hi>Prieſts;</hi> ſo that 'tis in vain for our Author to preſume that <hi>England,</hi> after ſo many Ages, teaches otherwiſe, and to affirm that this Teſtimony of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> doth not comprehend the Britiſh Churches. <hi>De Marca</hi> underſtood <hi>Innocent</hi> quite in a different ſenſe, ſuppoſing that the Britiſh Iſlands were underſtood by the Iſlands mention'd by <hi>Innocent:</hi> the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Innocent</hi> did not mention by name, <hi>thoſe Iſlands of the Mediterranean Sea,</hi> which lye between <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but only mentions <hi>the interjacent Iſlands in general,</hi> under which the Britiſh Iſlands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent to <hi>France,</hi> and partly interjacent, might, and, if we will believe antient Writers, ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. For from them it appears, as is before
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47567:31"/>prov'd, that the Churches in the Britiſh Iſlands were inſtituted, if not by <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, or by Preachers ſent by him, yet at leaſt by the Prieſts which his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Eleutherius</hi> conſtituted.</p>
               <p>9. Thus have I anſwer'd the Objection concerning Matter of Fact; and now proceed to the Second, which the Author urges againſt the Reaſon drawn from the Matter of Fact. <hi>Innocent</hi> ſo manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from the Inſtitution of the Weſtern Churches, that they ought to be ſubject to the Roman Patriarch, that our Author confeſſes it cannot be denied. <q>Yet <hi>ſaith he,</hi> let that be granted; what connexion is there between receiving the Doctrine at firſt, by thoſe who came from thence, and an Obligation to be ſubject to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in all their Orders and Traditions?</q> He asks the Reaſon of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, let him hear it from Chriſt, who would not have his Apoſtles to preach through the World, unleſs they were ſent; for being about to aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſpake to them in theſe Words, [as we find in the laſt Chapter of <hi>Mark</hi>] <hi>Go ye into all the World,</hi>

                     <hi>Mark.</hi> Chap. Laſt.</note> 
                  <hi>and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> And let him anſwer the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> thus asking, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> For <hi>how ſhall they preach, unleſs they are ſent?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>to the</hi> Romans.</note> Doth not the Apoſtle here affirm, that Miſſion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to preaching of the Goſpel? Ought not all to acknowledg that there ought to be a ſpecial Authority, when Churches are to be inſtituted by preaching, and Prieſts and Biſhops to be ordain'd? So the Apoſtles having receiv'd Power from Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to inſtruct the World by their preaching, and dividing amongſt themſelves the Regions of the whole Earth, inſtituted Churches, of which, thoſe only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Patriarchal Dignity, in which, <hi>Peter,</hi> either by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47567:32"/>himſelf, or by <hi>Mark</hi> his Diſciple, had placed Sees. He himſelf preſided at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he erected a See, which govern'd the Eaſtern Patriarchate. He ſent <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt his Diſciple to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whoſe See there erected conſtituted a Patriarchate, which in St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s time extended its Borders as far as <hi>India interior.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Carolus à S. Paulo <hi>in</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographia Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra.</note> For as <hi>Carolus à S. Paulo</hi> [in his <hi>Geographia Sacra</hi>] truly obſerves: This Cuſtom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd amongſt the Ancients, that the Provinces which were converted to Chriſtianity, ſhould remain ſubject to that Patriarch, by whoſe Induſtry and Vigilance they were firſt converted: and ſo <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>India interior</hi> appertain'd to the See of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe <hi>Frumentius</hi> being ſent thither by St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> preach'd the Goſpel, inſtructed the People in the Faith, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd their Biſhops, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> teſtifies, he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Aedeſius.</hi> So that it ought not to ſeem ſtrange to us, that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have obtain'd the Patriarchate of the Weſt, ſince the Prince of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles choſe that City for himſelf, and inſtituted Churches throughout the Weſt, and no other Apoſtle ordained Biſhops or Prieſts there, but he reſerved this Power to himſelf and his Succeſſors. This therefore is the Connexion between the receiving of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from thoſe which were ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Subjection of ſuch who were converted by them, which had their Miſſion from the Apoſtolic See; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Churches owe their Inſtitution to the ſpecial Authority of the Roman Biſhop; ſo that <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt rightly ſaid, that the Churches which had their Inſtitution from the Apoſtolic See, ought not to attend to the Inſtruction of Strangers, but to conſult the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhop,<note n="*" place="margin">Ne caput In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionum videantar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere.</note>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47567:32"/>
               <p>10. The Author obviates this argument, [<hi>p.</hi> 68] by aſſerting from antient Tradition out of <hi>Notkerus,</hi>

                  </q> The firſt words of the Author here, are to be obſerved, <hi>[If ſo,]</hi> ſaith he, ſo that he ſeems very much to doubt of the truth of the thing.

And, if we look into the more ancient Martyrologies, we ſhall not find one word in them, of <hi>Lucius</hi> his dying in <hi>Germany.</hi> Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> may be conſulted, who hath nothing, either at the Third of <hi>November</hi> or any other day, concerning this matter. Alſo a more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Martyrology of the Weſtern Church attributed to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> lately Printed at <hi>Lucca</hi> makes no mention of <hi>Lucius</hi> his being buried in <hi>Germany.</hi> An old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology ſet forth by <hi>Roſweidus</hi> ſince <hi>Baronius</hi> died, no where makes mention of <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> his being the Apoſtle of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Rhetia.</hi> Nor is he remembred in the Martyrologies of <hi>Rhabanas Maurus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuardus,</hi> and <hi>Ado Viennenſis;</hi> And <hi>Notkerus</hi> is the

               <p>1. I Have ſhew'd in the laſt Chapter that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church appertains to the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate by Right of Inſtitution. In this Chapter I am to ſhew that it is ſubject to it, although it had not receiv'd its firſt Inſtitution from the Apoſtolic See; for the Confirmation of which Truth, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Argument for the Subjection of Churches, is not only drawn from their Inſtitution, but alſo from the ancient Cuſtom of the Church, which, ſince we know not the firſt beginning of, is believ'd to have proceeded from Apoſtolical Preſcript. A great part of <hi>Illyricum</hi> was converted to the Faith by the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who inſtituted Churches, and ordain'd Biſhops there, from whence it comes to paſs that <hi>Innocent</hi> hath not reckon'd the Provinces of <hi>Illyricum</hi> amongſt thoſe which were inſtituted by <hi>Peter</hi> or his Succeſſors: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the <hi>Illyrican Dioceſs</hi> was not exempted from the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Roman Patriarchate.</hi> For it may be collected even from <hi>Innocent</hi> himſelf, though he hath not named the <hi>Illyrican Church</hi> amongſt thoſe which were inſtituted by the Apoſtolic See, yet that it was ſubject to the <hi>Roman Patriarchate.</hi> According as <hi>De Marca</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> hath collected [<hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de concordia Sacerdotii &amp; Imperii, Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.] where having related the Teſtimony of <hi>Innocent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Churches in the Weſt, that were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtolic See:<note place="margin">De Marca.</note> 
                  <q>The Dioceſſes, ſaith he, of the <hi>Illyrican Church</hi> are only wanting to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which <hi>Innocent</hi> hath not made mention of in

It is notwithſtanding certain, that theſe, no leſs than the reſt of the Weſtern Provinces, did obey the Apoſtolic See, and honoured it as the Head of the Churches. Do not take the thing upon my Credit. Let <hi>Innocent</hi> ſpeak for himſelf, in that Epiſtle which he wrote to <hi>Rufus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,</hi> (which was the Metropolis of <hi>Illyricum</hi>) and to the reſt of the Biſhops of <hi>Macedonia;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>4.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47567:38"/>that it ſhould have been inſtituted by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or his Succeſſors.

Dec. 384. <hi>three years after the Council of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>had advanced that See to the Patriarchal Dignity; which gave great occaſion of Jealouſie and Suſpition to the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>that being the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City as well as</hi> Rome; <hi>and</hi> Socrates <hi>obſerves,</hi> That from that time <hi>Nectarius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had the Government of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> as falling to his ſhare. <hi>This made the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>think it high time to look about them, and to inlarge their Juriſdiction, ſince the Biſhop of</hi> New-Rome <hi>had gain'd ſo large an Acceſſion by that Council; And to prevent his farther Incroachments Westwards, his Dioceſs of</hi> Thrace <hi>bordering upon</hi> Macedonia, <hi>the ſubtileſt Device they could think of, to ſecure that Province, and to inlarge their own Authority, was, to perſwade the Biſhop of</hi> Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47567:39"/>
                     <hi>to act as by Commiſſion from the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: <hi>So that he ſhould enjoy the ſame Priviledges which he had before. And being back'd by ſo great an Intereſt, he would be better able to conteſt with ſo powerful a Neighbour as the Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>And if any objected,</hi> That this was to break the Rules ſetled by the Council of <hi>Nice: They had that Anſwer ready;</hi> That the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> began: <hi>and their Concernment was, to ſecure the</hi> Rites <hi>of other</hi> Churches <hi>from being invaded by him; By which means they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to draw thoſe Churches bordering on the</hi> Thracian Dioceſs, <hi>firſt to own a Submiſſion to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>as their</hi> Patriarch; <hi>Which yet was ſo far from giving them eaſe, which ſome it may be expected by it, that it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly involved them in continual Troubles, as appears by that very</hi> Collection <hi>of</hi> Holſtenius. <hi>For the Biſhops of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople <hi>were not negligent in promoting their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Provinces of</hi> Illyricum, <hi>nor in withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Innovations <hi>of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. <hi>To which purpoſe they obtain'd an</hi> Imperial Edict <hi>to this day extant in both</hi> Codes, <hi>which ſtrictly forbids any</hi> Innovation <hi>in the Provinces of</hi> Illyricum, <hi>and declares,</hi> That if any doubtful Caſe happen'd, according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtom and Canons, it was to be left to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod, but not without the advice of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople. The occaſion whereof was this,</hi> Perigenes <hi>being rejected at</hi> Patrae, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>takes upon him to put him into</hi> Corinth, <hi>without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the</hi> Provincial Synod: <hi>This the Biſhops of</hi> Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly, <hi>among whom the chief were,</hi> Pauſianus, Cyriacus <hi>and</hi> Calliopus, <hi>look upon as a notorious</hi> Invaſion of their Rites; <hi>and therefore in a</hi> Provincial Synod <hi>they appoint another Perſon to ſucceed there. Which Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theirs is heinouſly taken at</hi> Rome, <hi>as appears by

               <p>5. Thus far our Author, affirming ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Decretal Epiſtles, which he cites, and falſly explaining other things, without any Teſtimony from Antiquity. But that we may not ſeem to have ſaid theſe things without good ground, they are to be proved; and I begin with thoſe things which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth contrary to the Decretal Epiſtles; where, I pray, does he find that <hi>the Biſhops of</hi> Theſſaly, <hi>among whom the chief were</hi> Pauſianus, Cyriacus, <hi>and</hi> Calliopus <hi>did oppoſe</hi> the Election of <hi>Perigenes</hi> Metropolitan of <hi>Corinth?</hi> Where does he read that they <hi>look'd upon</hi> the Inthronization of <hi>Perigenes, as a notorious invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and put <hi>Maximus</hi> in his Place lawfully, according to the Canons? The Author hints to us that he had theſe things out of <hi>Bonifacius</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Rufus:</hi> Let us ſee what the Epiſtle it ſelf, which is the Eighth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47567:40"/>thoſe ſet out by <hi>Holſtenius,</hi> ſays. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> in this Epiſtle to <hi>Rufus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> hath theſe Words:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>We require your Charity, convening our Fellow-biſhops above named, by whom</hi> Perrevius <hi>our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-biſhop complains he hath Injury done him, diligently to try the Cauſe, of which he hath given us an account in the Libel he hath ſent us, informing us that the Prelates his Brethren are very vexatious, ſo far as to think he ſhould be expel'd his Biſhoprick. Then that they may be given to underſtand, that whatever they have done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ancient Cuſtom, is in the firſt place to be made void, having diligently examin'd the whole Matter, let your Charity ſend us a ſpeedy account of it, to the end that the Judgment which your Brotherhood ſhall give, may be confirm'd by our Sentence. I would have you take notice what we have written in the Epiſtle to our Brethren of</hi> Theſſaly, <hi>that</hi> Pauſianus, Cyriacus, <hi>and</hi> Calliopus <hi>are utterly to be depriv'd of our Communion, ſo that they may know the only remedy they can have muſt be your favourable Interceſſion. As for</hi> Maximus, <hi>who, as your Charity hath inform'd us, is not rightly ordain'd; we judge it meet that he be wholly deprived of the Dignity of Prieſthood.</hi> This is taken out of the Epiſtle to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> which our Author hath mention'd, neither is there any other extant, in which <hi>Boniface</hi> makes mention of <hi>Cyriacus, Calliopus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus.</hi> But <hi>Boniface</hi> doth no where here intimate that <hi>Maximus</hi> was choſen in the place of <hi>Perigenes</hi> by <hi>Pauſianus, Cyriacus</hi> and <hi>Calliopus</hi> Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> according to the ancient Canons; which our Author might have been eaſily fatisfied of, if he had been well acquainted with the ancient Canons. For what had the three forenamed Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> to do with <hi>Perige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Metropolitan of the Province of <hi>Achaia?</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47567:40"/>Could the Authority of conſtituting another Biſhop in the room of <hi>Perigenes,</hi> whereof the Author deprives the Roman Biſhop and his Subſtitute in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the three Biſhops of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> according to the Canons? Is it not decreed in the Canons that no Authority belongs to the Biſhops of one Province over the Metropolitan of another? which if the Canons ordain, as it is certain they do, how can our Author impute the Tranſgreſſion of the Canons in the Cauſe of <hi>Perigenes,</hi> to <hi>Boniface,</hi> who never ſo much as dream'd of the Cauſe of <hi>Perigenes,</hi> when he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd the three Biſhops of <hi>Theſſaly?</hi> But it was a foul Miſtake in our Author, to read <hi>Perigenes</hi> inſtead of <hi>Perrevius.</hi> For <hi>Boniface</hi> in the Place above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, doth not ſpeak of <hi>Perigenes</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Achaia,</hi> whom the Biſhops of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> had no Power, either to Ordain or Conſecrate; but of <hi>Perrevius,</hi>

                  </gap>: and I will prove from the very Acts themſelves, that he was of the Province of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> For ſince <hi>Perre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been lawfully elected, and duly ordain'd, and afterwards for ſome fictitious Crimes, to have been depoſed by his Fellow-biſhops of the Province of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> I cannot but think he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Province of thoſe Biſhops who gave Judgment concerning him, from which their Sentence <hi>Perrevius</hi> notwithſtanding appeal'd to the Apoſtolic See. <hi>Boniface</hi> committed the Care of peruſing the Heads of this Appeal to <hi>Rufus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> his Vicar in <hi>Illyricum;</hi> which being duly examin'd by him and ſent to <hi>Rome, Boniface</hi> thought fit that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revius</hi> ſhould be reſtored to his See, and that the three
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47567:41"/>Biſhops above named who depoſed <hi>Perrevius,</hi> ſhould be excommunicated: and ſo he made uſe of that Authority, which belong'd to him over <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and confuted by the exerciſe of his Power, all theſe fictions of our Author before they were fram'd.</p>
               <p>6. Now let us clear the cauſe of <hi>Perigenes,</hi> in which our Author mixes falſehood with truth, and explicates many things untruly without any teſtimony of the Ancients. It is indeed true that in the year 352. <hi>Nectarious</hi> in the ſecond General Synod [<hi>Canon</hi> 3.] obtain'd, that the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which heretofore was a Suffragan, ſhould have Priority of honour after the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having tranſlated the Imperial Throne to that City, it became the See of new <hi>Rome.</hi> It is alſo true, that, from this Canon unlawfully made, the Biſhops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> took occaſion by degrees to extend the bounds of their Juriſdiction, and that having taken in the three exarchates of <hi>Thrace, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> they began to take upon them the hearing the cauſes of the Eaſtern part of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> which then was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Weſtern part. Let it alſo be granted true, that the Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> had the Authority of the Apoſtolic See over <hi>Illyricum</hi> firſt delegated to him by Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> that he might the better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Uſurpations of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> yet it cannot be denied, but that it was upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople's</hi> drawing the cauſe of <hi>Perigenes</hi> before his Tribunal, that there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a Controverſie between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi>

               <p>7. Hitherto we have recounted thoſe things which are true, now let us proceed to ſhew what falſhoods the Author has intermixt with them. And in the firſt place it is falſe that the foremention'd Law was made againſt the invaſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop: for it was not made againſt the invaſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to further the unlawful Uſurpation of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> They had not here regard to the Authority of Provincial Synods for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certain and undoubtful cauſes, but to doubtful caſes, ſuch as was that of <hi>Perigenes,</hi> which could not be determined by the Synod without the judgment of the Patriarch. Now there was no Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about a Patriarchal Power over <hi>Illyricum</hi> in the time of <hi>Perigenes;</hi> the only queſtion that was mov'd, was to which of the Patriarchs it belong'd. <hi>Illyricum,</hi> even to the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Second, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Weſt: but the Empire being divided between <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Weſtern part of <hi>Illyricum</hi> was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that of the Eaſt, and the Eaſtern part
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47567:42"/>fell to <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperor of the Eaſt; from whence the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> took occaſion to perſwade <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who was of an eaſie nature, that he would make the Churches of the Eaſtern <hi>Illyricum</hi> Subject to the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> See, which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſo effected by making a new Law, as plainly to ſhew, that there was no queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Patriarchal Power over <hi>Illyricum,</hi> but only a difficulty ſtarted, <hi>viz.</hi> whether this power ſhould, for the future, appertain to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop or to the <hi>Constantinopolitan, Theodoſius</hi> his words are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:<note place="margin">Theodoſius <hi>Imperator.</hi>

                  <hi>Then if there ariſe any doubtful caſe, that must be reſerved to the Sacerdotal Synod and Sacred Judicatory, not without the knowledge of the moſt Reverend the Prelate of the Sacred Law, who holds his See in the City of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>which enjoys the Prerogative of Old Rome.</hi> You hear, that therefore the judgment in doubtful caſes was reſerv'd to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> or New <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was then called, becauſe it enjoy'd the Prerogative of Old <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prerogative was Tranſlated to the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan</hi> See,<note place="margin">

For as much as the Legates that were ſent to us, have deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from our Piety, but what is agreeable to Catholic faith, diſcipline, and equity: for they require of us, that thoſe priviledges, which having been eſtabliſh'd long ſince by our fore-fathers were preſervd till this time, may ever remain inviolable: and afterwards, Wherefore we deſire your Majeſty, that being mindful of that Chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which the Divine mercy hath infuſed into our hearts, you would conſider of our Pious diſcourſe; and that removing all theſe [uſurpt Rights,] which are ſaid to have been gain'd by the private deſigns of diverſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, you would command that the ancient order be kept: that ſo the</hi> Roman <hi>Church may not loſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian Princes what ſhe preſerv'd under other Emperors.</hi> Hence it is clear that when <hi>Boniface</hi> the Pope deſir'd that the Patriarchal right over <hi>Illyricum</hi> might be reſtor'd to him, he ask'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was againſt the Canons or the ancient Order: which was not only acknowledg'd by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> the Weſtern Emperor, but alſo by <hi>Theodoſius</hi>

So that it appears to be plainly falſe, that <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt and other Biſhops endeavour'd to gain a Patriarchal power, which they had not before, over <hi>Illyricum,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>to act as by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from them;</hi> which notwithſtanding, after our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writer the Author of the Treatiſe <hi>[De Diſciplina Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae]</hi> hath endeavoured to obtrude upon the World. Indeed it ought not to ſeem ſo great a wonder, that this ſhould have bin ſaid by one that was not of the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſince ſomething is to be indulged to the Prejudice of a diſturbed mind:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47567:43"/>But I know not how it came to paſs, that a man who profeſſes himſelf to live in the Communion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic See ſhould raſhly utter thoſe things, which I can hardly relate without bluſhing.</p>

Now ſince the <hi>Illyrican</hi> Churches notwithſtanding they were inſtituted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> yet belong'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate; what ſhould hinder the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches from being ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate, although <hi>Paul,</hi> and not <hi>Peter,</hi> had firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted them, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author makes it his main endeavour to prove.

               <p>10. The affixing the Britiſh Church to the Roman Patriarchate depends upon this Apoſtolical Inſtitute, and upon this account it was that Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the Britiſh Biſhops amongſt thoſe that appertain'd to the Council of the Roman Patriarchate. There is an evident Teſtimony, not only of <hi>Agatho,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a hundred and twenty Weſtern Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter, which is read in the Synodic Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the ſixth General Council,<note place="margin">Synodic.

In my Judgment, Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> and the hundred and twenty Biſhops could not have ſaid, that the Britiſh Churches were ſubject to the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47567:44"/>as Patriarch of the Weſt, more clearly than they have done. Neither could the Biſhops of the whole Eaſtern Church, aſſembled in Council at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> have any way more manifeſtly confirm'd this Truth than by their approbation of the foremention'd Epiſtle of <hi>Agatho,</hi> and inſerting it into their Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts. The Weſtern Biſhops ſent this Epiſtle to thoſe of the Eaſt, and which is chiefly to be here conſidered, the Britiſh Biſhops made it their own by ſubſcribing to it. And all the Eaſtern Biſhops gave their Approbation to it, by inſerting it into their Acts. So that all who contradict this Epiſtle, may be ſaid to oppoſe the Judgment both of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Biſhops; and that the Engliſh, whilſt they deny its Authority, recede from the Judgment of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and affect to be wiſer than their Fore-fathers. Neither is the Authority of <hi>Agatho</hi>'s Epiſtle of the leſs force, becauſe it was written after <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s coming into <hi>England;</hi> for there is no Innovation in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but the ancient Cuſtom of the Church is kept up, according to which, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor declar'd before <hi>Agatho</hi>'s time, that the Roman Patriarch had preſided over the whole Weſt, and ſo conſequently over <hi>Britain,</hi> as appears from his <hi>109th.

                  <hi>Qui majores Dioeceſes tenes, who holdeſt the greater Dioceſſes,</hi> to ſignifie, that he did not preſide over one Dioceſs, but many Dioceſſes; to wit, all thoſe which were compriſed within the bounds of the Weſt. And ſince the Matter is ſo, who does not ſee that this might have diſpleaſed our Author, and given him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to change the Text. For ſince his Opinion concerning the reſtriction of the Bounds of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Patriarchate is overthrown by this one Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Council of <hi>Arles;</hi> it is likely he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to read only <hi>Dioeceſim, Dioceſs,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Dioeceſes, Dioceſſes,</hi> that ſo he might infringe the force of this Argument. For ſo, he who as preſiding over many Dioceſſes, did extend his Patriarchal Authority even to <hi>Britain,</hi> obtaining by this means only a Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Dioceſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> would be reſtrained within the bounds thereof.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47567:48"/>
               <p>3. And that this is that which our Author hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to obtrude upon his Party, by changing the Text of the Council,<note place="margin">Pag. 130.</note> he ſufficiently diſcovers when he again mentions the Synodical Epiſtle of the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi> 
                  <q>But as to the Expreſſion of <hi>Majores Dioeceſes,</hi> it is, ſaith he, very queſtionable whether in the time of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> the diſtribution of the Empire by <hi>Constantine</hi> into Dioceſſes were then made, and it ſeems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not to have been done in the time of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> Dioceſſes not being mentioned there, but only Provinces; and if ſo, this Place muſt be corrupt in that Expreſſion, as it is moſt certain it is in others; and it is hard to lay ſo great weight on a place that makes no entire ſenſe. But allowing the Expreſſion genuine, it implies no more than that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had then more extenſive Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes than other Weſtern Biſhops, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</q> Our Author here clearly explains his Mind, who, that he might ſome way or other prove the Text to be corrupt, brings ſome reaſons for his way of reading of it, which muſt be here weighed. And firſt he hints to us, that the Empire was diſtributed into Dioceſſes under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, before the time of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> yet that this ſeems to have been done after the time of the Nicene Council, ſo that the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> could not make mention of the <hi>Greater Dioceſſes: It is very questionable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether in the time of the Council of</hi> Arles, <hi>the diſtribution of the Empire by</hi> Conſtantine <hi>into Dioceſſes were made; and it ſeems more probable not to have been done in the time of the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes not being mentioned there, but only Provinces.</hi> But our Author is greatly miſtaken, adding one Error to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47567:48"/>another; and whilſt he ſpeaks in this manner, plainly ſhews that he hath not well peruſed the Acts which were publiſhed in the time of the <hi>Nicene Council.</hi> For in the Epiſtle of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> concerning the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on one and the ſame Day throughout the whole World, which he wrote at the very time of the <hi>Nicene Council;</hi> there is mention made not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of divers Provinces under the Name of one Region, but likewiſe the Dioceſſes of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly named, <gap reason="foreign">

It is certain therefore that there were Dioceſſes in the Empire at the time of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> which betrays our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Ignorance, and diſcovers his great Error about this Matter.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith that it is doubtful, when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> diſtributed the Empire into Dioceſſes, which relates nothing to the Queſtion in hand; ſince there were Dioceſſes in the Empire before its being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted under four <hi>Praefecti Praetorio;</hi> ſo that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> might have uſed the Word <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> in their time, as no body yet has made any doubt but they did. They attribute Dioceſſes to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> therefore there were then Dioceſſes in the Empire, under the Name of which, the Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Amplitude of Patriarchal Juriſdiction. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphrius Panuinus</hi> giving an Account of the Diviſion of the Provinces as it ſtood in the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperor, amongſt other Titles, preſixes one to the Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> by which he aſſerts,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>that there were ſeventeen Provinces or Dioceſſes in</hi> Italy, <hi>and in the Iſlands which belong to it.</hi> Now although it doth not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47567:49"/>appear to me, by what means he knew that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were then called Dioceſſes; yet I can make no doubt, but that he found this as alſo all the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which he there relates in ancient Monuments: let us therefore lay it down for a certain Truth, that the Name of Dioceſs was attributed even to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces from the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi> himſelf; and then no body can deny, but that the Provinces were leſſer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes, in reſpect to the greater; of which <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> hath made mention in his Breviary,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sextus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> in Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ario. <hi>Conſtantinus M.</hi> Epiſt. ad omnes Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</note> where we read, <hi>that in the Dioceſs of</hi> Macedonia <hi>there were ſeven Provinces conſtituted;</hi> and of which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great hath made mention in his Epiſtle to the Churches, calling to mind the <hi>Pontic and Aſian Dioceſs,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Nicene Council.</hi> Therefore that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> might give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they meant ſuch ſort of Dioceſſes, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>greater Dioceſſes</hi> to the leſſer,<note place="margin">Patres Arela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes in Epiſt.

Sylveſter</hi> therefore held Dioceſſes at the time of the Celebration of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> and ſo he did not preſide over a few Provinces only, which conſtituted the leſſer Dioceſſes, but over many Tracts of the World, which made the greater Dioceſſes, and in theſe he obtain'd a Patriarchal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Our Author ſays, that ſince the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> doth not mention Dioceſſes but Provinces, <hi>it follows, that this place muſt be corrupt:—but allowing the Expreſſion genuine, it implies no more than that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>had then more extenſive Dioceſſes than other Weſtern Biſhops, which is not denied.</hi> But before I anſwer to this laſt particular, I ſhall with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's good leave, make ſome few Obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47567:49"/>the acception of the Word Dioceſſes at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> He ſays that the Name of <hi>Dioeceſis</hi> was unknown to the <hi>Nicene Fathers;</hi> and ſo, as we have heard before, that the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> could not have made mention of more Dioceſſes; therefore that the place is corrupt, and that inſtead of <hi>Majores Dioeceſes, greater Dioceſſes,</hi> we ought to read <hi>Majorem Dioeceſim, greater Dioceſs.</hi> But in what ancient Book, I pray, doth he find this manner of reading? Out of what old Author hath he diſcover'd this? If he hath learn'd this from no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, no Author, it muſt neceſſarily follow he has feign'd it, and was the firſt that ever dream'd of ſuch a thing. Again, if we are to ſubſtitute the Words <hi>greater Dioceſs,</hi> and our Author believes the place is to be thus read, then the Word <hi>Dioeceſis</hi> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> as he, contradicting himſelf, ſays it was. He ſuppoſes indeed, that, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this Authority not to have been corrupted, it follows, that the Roman Biſhop hath a Dioceſs of a greater extenſion than thoſe of other Biſhops; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it really follows from hence, that he hath not one Dioceſs only, but many; for ſo the Fathers write to St. <hi>Sylveſter, Qui majores Dioeceſes tenes, who holdeſt the greater Dioceſſes.</hi> If therefore the place be ſincere, as it is teſtified to be, as to theſe Words, by thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, out of which firſt <hi>Pittheus,</hi> afterwards <hi>Sirmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> publiſhed the Epiſtle in <hi>France</hi> before our time; from thence it is deduced, that <hi>Sylveſter</hi> held many of the greater Dioceſſes, and that the late Author <hi>de Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina Eccleſiae</hi> is greatly miſtaken, when, commenting on the Words of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> upon his own Authority, without any Teſtimony from Antiquity, he

Do not the Fathers declare in the firſt Canon, that they did this, becauſe it was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient Cuſtom?</p>
               <p>7. Our Author cannot deny this; but he objects, Page 84. that the Authority of declaring on what day <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſhould be obſerv'd, was taken away from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Nicene Council. <q>The Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> ſaith he, decreed <hi>Can.</hi> 1. as to <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> that it ſhould be obſerv'd on the ſame Day and Time throughout the World; and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould give notice of the Day according to Cuſtom.

Hence, what ſhould not, most commonly comes to paſs, that all Churches, which ought to be as one, do not obſerve it at the ſame time. The Holy Fathers therefore have made it their endeavour to take away the occaſion of this Error, by committing the whole care of this Matter to the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria; <hi>becauſe the Skill in this Computation ſeem'd to be receiv'd amongst the Aegyptians from ancient Tradition, by which Skill the Apoſtolic See was to be inform'd on what day the aforeſaid Solemnity fell out yearly, that the Knowledge thereof might be generally conveyed to the Churches more remote.</hi> The laſt Words of <hi>Leo</hi> are to be taken notice of; for from theſe it plainly appears, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Day, communicated to the Apoſtolic See by the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was yet to be publiſhed by the Apoſtolic See in the Churches which were more remote from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the Weſtern Churches were. <hi>Leo</hi> the Firſt, in his <hi>9th.</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> writes that this did belong to his own Charge, by Divine Inſtitution, and by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Fathers;<note place="margin">Innocentius I. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Vid. num.</hi> XXVII.</note> and we have an eminent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this Truth in the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt to <hi>Aurelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> wherein he writes thus. <hi>I have writ this Epiſtle to you beforehand, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Computation of</hi> Eaſter-day <hi>for another, (I mean the next) Year: For whereas almoſt the ſixteenth Moon (for it is ſomething leſs) is reckon'd before the eleventh day of the Kalends of</hi> April, <hi>and alſo the twenty third comes ſometime before the fourth day of the ſame Kalends,

                  <hi>by the conſent of the Synod, of the Holy Fathers throughout the whole World, that, becauſe there was ſuch a Church found to be at</hi> Alexandria, <hi>which was eminent for their Skill in finding out on what Day of the Kalends or Ides, and in what Moon</hi> Eaſter <hi>ought to be celebrated; this Church ſhould every Year by their Letters intimate this to the Roman Church, from whence by Apoſtolick Authority, the univerſal Church might know, without any further diſpute, the determin'd day of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>throughout the whole World.

                  <hi>Victor Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>forthwith endeavours to cut off from the Catholic Communion all the Churches of</hi> Aſia, <hi>and the neighbouring Provinces, as diſſenters from the right Faith; and, by the Letters which he ſent, interdicts all the Brethren which were there, and pronounces them to be wholly aliens from the unity of the Church.</hi> The Letters, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath here mention'd, are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47567:54"/>loſt to the great detriment of Eccleſiaſtical Learning. For if they were extant, it is probable it might be Collected from the very words of <hi>Victor,</hi> how by vertue of his Supreme Pontifical Authority he Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>Polycrates</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and other <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops, or at leaſt terrified them with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication. But whetherſoever of theſe is aſcribed to <hi>Victor,</hi> it is certain, that he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Authority of his See, concerning which no Catholic <hi>Biſhop</hi> did then contend with him. For <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and other Weſtern Biſhops did only exhort him, that he would abſtain from denouncing the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excomunication, or at leaſt revoke it after it was denounc'd, as I have ſhew'd elſewhere from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius.</hi> And let it ſuffice to have ſaid thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt Canon of the Council of <hi>Arles;</hi> which is read two ſeveral ways in the Manuſcripts: in ſome thus, that the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Decree to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> for the celebration of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon one and the ſame day, <hi>per omnem <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbem, through every City;</hi> in others, <hi>per omnem Orbem, through the whole World.</hi> Our Author may make choice of which of theſe Readings he ſhall think fit; for he cannot reaſonably deny but that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal or Papal Authority <hi>is proved from hence:</hi> nay if he be wiſe, he will admit of the Patriarchal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the whole Weſt, and of the Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the whole World. For it is evident from Teſtimonies of the Primitive Fathers, which none that is prudent will deſpiſe, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop did preſcribe the day whereon <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be obſerv'd to the Primates and Metropolitans in the Weſt, and by theſe to the Suffragan Biſhops, as <hi>Leo Magnus</hi> teſtifies;

                  <hi>when</hi> Paul <hi>would by no means depart out of the body of the Church,</hi> Aurelianus <hi>the Emperor, being appeal'd to, rightly determin'd the matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Church to be deliver'd to thoſe, to whom the</hi> Italian <hi>Prelates of the Chriſtian Religion, and the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops ſhould write.

               <p>3. But if it appears by what hath been ſaid, that before the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> the Oriental Synods that were celebrated, not by the Metropolitans of one Province only but of many, had not Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church; what ſhall we ſay concerning the Authority of ſimple Provincial Synods? The <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebians</hi> themſelves in their Conventicle at <hi>Philippopolis</hi> did not defend the Authority of theſe as Supream. For when the Great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> being condemn'd by <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Council, fled to <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Euſebians</hi> ſubmitted their cauſe to the judgment of the ſame Pope: but, obſerving that they were like to be condemn'd they began to impugn the Authority of the Pope, whom they could not gain to their party: and were the firſt that ever contended, not that the Sentence of one ſingle Province was of ſo great Authority, that from it no Appeal could be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47567:57"/>made to a higher Judicatory, as the Author of the Book [<hi>de antiqua Eccleſiae diſciplina, diſſertation.</hi> 2.] hath lately feigned: but that the Eaſtern Church was diſtinct from the Weſtern, as in Name, ſo alſo in Juriſdiction; and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not to judge in that matter concerning which an Eaſtern Synod had given ſentence: For which cauſe <hi>Julius</hi> the firſt accuſes them of raſhneſs and innovation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king anſwer in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Euſebians,</hi>

                  </q> Thus this Author, not ſcrupling to affix the new whimſies of an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor, and the dreams of the Conventicle of <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> upon St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> But I muſt not inſiſt upon theſe things, ſince they do not deſerve an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>4. Let us therefore proceed to our Authors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Third Canon, which is the Sixth in order among the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons; for the things which he relates here are new, and ſcarce ever heard of. The Canon,<note place="margin">Canon <hi>6.</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenus. Vid. num. <hi>XXXVI.</hi>
                  </note> of which we treat, runs thus according to the Verſion of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus: Let the ancient Cuſtom be kept through</hi> Egypt, Lybia <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis, <hi>that the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>have juriſdiction over all theſe, becauſe the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath a like cuſtom. Likewiſe in</hi> Antioch, <hi>and other Provinces, let the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of their Churches be preſerved. But this is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally clear, that, if any one be made Biſhop without the conſent of the Metropolitan, the great Synod hath defined that he ought not to be a Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c. There is one thing in this Canon, which our Author, becauſe it deſtroys his deſign, interprets after a ſtrange manner. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the opinion of thoſe, that acknowledge no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſuperior to that of a Metropolitan: now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon aſcribes an Authority to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> over all <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapolis,</hi> and hath expreſly declared that the like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47567:58"/>had obtained at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> that their Biſhops preſided over many Provinces: our Author following the Error of <hi>Beverage,</hi> hath aſſerted that there was no Metropolitan in <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapolis</hi> in the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; and ſo he would make the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be a Patriarch as to the extent of his Authority, and a Metropolitan only as to the adminiſtration of it.</p>
               <p>5. If the Reader will not believe me, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Authors own words, which are theſe: <q>In this Canon there are three things principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. (1.) To confirm the ancient Privileges of ſome of the greater Sees; as <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> (2.) To ſecure the Privileges of other Churches againſt the Encroachments upon them. (3.) To provide for the quiet eſtabliſhment of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Churches, which laſt is ſo plain that it will need no farther diſcourſe; But the other two are of great conſequence to our deſign.</q> Thus the Author; firſt of all confeſſing that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers did confirm the ancient privileges of ſome of the principal Sees, in which they had gain'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a more ample Power than that of a Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan only; by which means the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi> under his juriſdiction, over which he exerciſed the Patriarchal Authority of Conſecrating Biſhops, calling Synods, and judging in the greater Eccleſiaſtical cauſes. Now leaſt any one ſhould from hence infer that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had obtain'd a greater Power then that of a Metropolitan; he aſſerts, that he had then no Metropolitans under him in thoſe Provinces; and that the rite of Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal adminiſtration was co-incident with the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47567:59"/>at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſo different from that which was afterwards introduc'd. Therefore he confeſſes that there was ſomething that was ſingular in the caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> 
                  <q>For <hi>ſaith he,</hi> all the Provinces of <hi>Egypt</hi> were under his immediate care, which was Patriarchal as to Extent, but Metropolitical in the Adminiſtration. And ſo was the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time; which is the true reaſon of bringing the cuſtom of <hi>Rome</hi> to juſtifie that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For as it is well obſerv'd by <hi>Chriſtianus Lupus, the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>had then no Metropolitans under him within the Provinces ſubject to his juriſdiction;</hi> and ſo all Appeals lay immediately from the ſeveral Biſhops to him. And therein lay the exact paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>6. Therefore our Author aſſerts, that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had no Metropolitans under him; and that in this lay its likeneſs to the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate. But before we come to enquire, whether it be true that the Patriarchs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> had no Metropolitans under them, let us firſt ſee briefly whether no Metropolitans were ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. For our Author confeſſes that the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> does reach him alſo. The Church of Antioch was the principal Church of all the Eaſt, and had under it fifteen Provinces, which the <hi>Notitia Imperii</hi> reckons to be compriſed under the Eaſtern Dioceſe: and ſince the Eaſt was firſt enlightened with the Chriſtian Faith, and the name of Chriſtians, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifies, was firſt heard at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it is very probable, that that Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy firſt took place there, which is deſcrib'd in the 35th of thoſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47567:59"/>Canons which are attributed to the Apoſtles, to wit, that there were Biſhops conſtituted in the Cities, and that a chief Biſhop was placed in the Metropolis of every Province, to the end that the Biſhops of every Nation might know who was their Chief. So that <hi>Tarſus</hi> being the Metropolis of the chief part of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> the Biſhop of this City might as Metropolitan ſubſcribe in the firſt place, to thoſe Letters, which the ſecond Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſet forth againſt <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatenus.</hi> So was alſo <hi>Caeſarea</hi> the Metropolis of the cheif part of <hi>Palestine;</hi> in which, it ſo manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that there was a Metropolitan Biſhop long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that there can be no doubt made of the thing. For when Pope <hi>Victor</hi> had writ to <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> to call a Council for the determining of <hi>Eaſter</hi> day,<note place="margin">Fragmentum Synodi <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis</hi> apud <hi>Bedum.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Biſhop having receiv'd this Order</hi> (as the Acts of this Council recorded in Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> inform us) <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd all the Biſhops not only from his own Province, but alſo from diverſe other Regions.</hi> What is more clear then this? There is a diſtinct Province aſſigned to <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> as Metropolitan, out of which he ſummon'd the Biſhops to Council: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had his own proper Province, over the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop whereof he preſided. This is farther evidenced from the fact of <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had referred the Debate concerning the Error of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and is for this cauſe, reprehended by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>You, who ſeek for Eccleſiaſtical rules, and make uſe of the Canons of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council—tell me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D. <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Epiſt. ad <hi>Pamachium.</hi> Vid. num. <hi>XXXVII.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>what hath</hi> Paleſtine <hi>to do with the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria? <hi>If I miſtake not, this is what that Council hath determin'd,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> Caeſarea <hi>ſhould be the Metropolis of</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47567:60"/>Antioch the Metropolis of the whole Eaſt: therefore you ſhould either have brought your cauſe before the Biſhop of</hi> Caeſarea — <hi>or if you were to go far for a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you ſhould rather have directed your Letters to</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch—<hi>you choſe to be troubleſome to one who had his head full of buſineſs already, rather then to pay to your Metropolitan that honour which was due to him.</hi> Thus ſaith S. <hi>Jerom</hi> [in his 61. Epiſtle to <hi>Pammachius</hi>] plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerting that, according to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to ſubmit to the Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> as his Metropolitan, and to the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> as his Patriarch: whence it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> had, at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> under his Juriſdiction, even in <hi>Palestine</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>7. This being ſo, what anſwer can our Author make? what can he invent, what can he dream of, to elude this verity? Will he ſay, that he did not ſpeak concerning the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but only concerning the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchs; that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon only declares there was a likeneſs between theſe two? In Prudence he will never anſwer thus for he hath interpreted the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon ſo as to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the rights of the three principal Sees, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe of <hi>Antioch</hi> amongſt the reſt. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt from what hath been ſaid, that the See of <hi>Antioch</hi> had under it more Metropolitan Biſhops then one, is not that apparently falſe which our Author imitating <hi>Beverage</hi> hath feigned, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in its Sixth Canon, hath acknowledg'd no Authority ſuperior to that of a Metropolitan? Is it not manifeſtly prov'd that he impoſes an Error upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, when to defend the Metropolitan Power as Supream, he aſſerts that all other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47567:60"/>ſuperior to this was unknown to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council? I judge that what hath been ſaid ought to beſufficient to make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> open their Eyes, and forſake and deteſt the Error they have imbibed, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Supremacy of the Metropolitcal Authority.</p>
               <p>8. Thus far enough of the Patriarchate of <hi>Antioch;</hi> Let us now ſpeak of that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had a power over many Provinces before the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; which the Sixth Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> plainly declares, whilſt it ordains that the ancient cuſtom ſhould be obſerv'd according to which the Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> exerciſed a juriſdiction over <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis.</hi> This is expreſly commemorated (of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> who govern'd the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> Sixty years before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council) by St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> [<hi>lib. de ſententia Dionyſii contra Arianos</hi> in theſe words:<note place="margin">D. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> de ſententia <hi>Dionyſii.</hi> Vid. num. <hi>XXXVIII.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Epiphanius <hi>Haereſi.</hi> 68. <hi>Vid. num.</hi> XXXIX.</note> or <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> as alſo other Churches diſtributed through the reſt of the Provinces of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dioceſe were under the charge of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> as St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us [<hi>Hereſi.</hi> 68.] where he deteſts the Original of the <hi>Meletian</hi> Schiſm: <hi>Meletius,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, eſpecially</hi> Peter <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>were then in bonds: and</hi> Meletius, <hi>though he excell'd the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of</hi> Egypt, <hi>yet was ſecond to</hi> Peter <hi>in dignity, as being his Suffragane, yet ſubject to him, and referring Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiastical
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47567:61"/>Cauſes to his Juriſdiction. For it is the Right of the Arch-Biſhops of</hi> Alexandria <hi>to adminiſter Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Affairs throughout all</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and</hi> Thebais, Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otis, Lybia, Ammoniaca, <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis. From theſe ancient Teſtimonies, the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> over all the Provinces throughout <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is clearly proved; neither do I ſee that any doubt can be made of this; it remains therefore for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether there was at that time no Metropolitan Biſhop to be found in any of the Provinces of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. This our Author denies, as to the times before the <hi>Nicene Council;</hi> but upon what ground I know not. For <hi>Meletius</hi> held a Biſhoprick in <hi>Thebais</hi> before the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the place above mentioned hath recorded, that he in the time of St. <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was crown'd with Martyrdom, about fourteen years before the <hi>Nicene Council, excelling the other Egyptian Biſhops, was the ſecond to</hi> Peter <hi>in Dignity.</hi> Now how could <hi>Meletius</hi> then have obtain'd the ſecond Place to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> by what Right could he have excell'd the other Egyptian Biſhops, unleſs he had been a Metropolitan? If you would have a farther Confirmation of the thing, conſult St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who tells us that <hi>Meletius</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Biſhops in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and, in the Breviary of the Biſhops conſecrated by <hi>Meletius,</hi> names <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Memphis</hi> in the laſt place: <gap reason="foreign">

Neither hath any one reaſon to alledge the Paraphraſe of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> concerning the Suburbicarian Regions, againſt us, and to affirm with <hi>Salmaſius</hi> that theſe were confined within the ſpace of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47567:62"/>a hundred Miles from the City, or within the Bounds of the Lieutenancy of the City, as a late French Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have them to be. All which, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute at large, in the ſecond Edition of <hi>[Antiquitas Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrata]</hi> and ſhew to be erroneous. In the mean time, who will not admire that there ſhould be ſuch Men to be found, who, notwithſtanding they may plainly ſee that the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> had fifteen Eaſtern Provinces, and the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſix Provinces of <hi>Aegypt</hi> under thier Juriſdiction; yet can have the confidence to affirm, that the Patriarchal Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was confin'd to the narrow ſpace of a hundred Miles, or but few more from the City? If the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> obtain'd a Patriarchal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over a larger Dioceſs of the Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Roman Biſhops had the like Cuſtom; then we muſt of neceſſity allow the Roman Biſhop to have obtain'd a Juriſdiction over at leaſt a like Dioceſs of the Empire. But the firſt Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> ten years before that of <hi>Nice,</hi> expreſly declared, that <hi>Sylveſter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> held not only one, but many greater Dioceſſes; nor is it any where read, that theſe Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were taken away from <hi>Sylveſter</hi> in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time; it muſt then be held for certain, that he retain'd them all at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and conſequently, that the Popes had not only a Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Juriſdiction over the Provinces that were near the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo over all the reſt of the Weſtern Provinces, amongſt which the Britiſh are to be reckon'd.</p>

                        <item>1. <hi>Our Author hath conjectur'd from a certain Anſwer made by the</hi> Britiſh Biſhops <hi>and the Monks of</hi> Banchor <hi>to</hi> Auguſtine Gregory<hi>'s Legate, that</hi> Britain <hi>did acknowledge no Authority Superior to that of a Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, till ſuch time as</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great was Pope; which he endeavors to prove from</hi> Bede, <hi>and</hi> Spelman <hi>from an ancient Engliſh Manuſcript.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The Manuſcript ſet forth by</hi> Spelman, <hi>and approv'd of by our Author, is ſuppoſitious and lately invented. The</hi> Engliſh Church, <hi>from the time of its firſt planting, hath acknowledg'd an Authority Superior to that of a Metropolitan in the</hi> Roman Biſhop; <hi>as is ſhew'd from the firſt Council of</hi> Arles, <hi>wherein three</hi> Britiſh Biſhops <hi>were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The ſame thing is prov'd from the Canons and Epiſtle of the Council of</hi> Sardica, <hi>wherein St.</hi> Athanaſius <hi>mentions the</hi> Britiſh Biſhops <hi>to have been preſent.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. Pelagius, <hi>a</hi> Britain, <hi>diſcover'd this, when after his Hereſie was condemn'd in an</hi> Eaſtern Synod, <hi>he would not only have his Cauſe brought before the Tribunal of the</hi> Roman Biſhop, <hi>but ſent alſo a Book, wherein he gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Faith, together with an Epiſtle to</hi> Innocent <hi>the Firſt, as appears from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of</hi> Auguſtin <hi>and</hi> Oſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</item>
                        <item>5. Celeſtius <hi>the Diſciple of</hi> Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, <hi>being of the</hi> Britiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>alſo, acknowledg'd this more clearly; whilſt, being condemn'd for his Hereſie in the Council of</hi> Carthage, he thought fit to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47567:63"/>appeal from the Sentence of the Synod to the Tribunal of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, as</hi> Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Mercator <hi>teſtifies. For 'twas his Duty to proſecute that Appeal, as</hi> Paulinus, <hi>Deacon to St.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>aſſerts.</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>7. <hi>Venerable</hi> Bede <hi>teſtifies the ſame thing concerning</hi> Palladius <hi>the Apoſtle of the</hi> Scots; <hi>and</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus Weſtmonaſterienſis <hi>of St.</hi> Patrick <hi>the Apoſtle of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</item>
                        <item>8. <hi>This is likewiſe manifeſtly prov'd from what</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great did for the Reſtauration of the Catholic Religion in</hi> Britain. <hi>For he ſent</hi> Auguſtine <hi>as Legate of the Apoſtolic See, that he might inſtitute Churches, ordain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, and Conſecrate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the Iſland, who ſhould be all bound to obey his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>

                        <item>10. <hi>But ſuppoſing that the Monks of</hi> Banchor <hi>had contradicted the Popes Primacy, this Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be no Proof againſt it, ſince</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſhew'd, that what they held was falſe, by a Miracle which gave Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the Truth which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</hi>

               <p>1. OUR Author, in the Concluſion of his Book, propoſeth theſe things which are ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſpoken by the Monks of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh Biſhops</hi> upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Augustine</hi>'s being ſent amongſt them; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he hath theſe Words:<note place="margin">Pag. 357.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being furniſhed with ſuch full Powers, as he thought, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a Meeting with the <hi>Britiſh Biſhops,</hi> at a Place
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47567:63"/>called <hi>Auguſtinſac,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith (in the Confines of the <hi>Wiccii</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi>)—but at this Place the <hi>Britiſh Biſhops</hi> gave <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a Meeting; where the firſt thing propoſed by him was, that they would embrace the Unity of the Catholic Church, and then joyn with them in preaching to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> for, ſaith he, they did many things repugnant to the Unity of the Church; which was in plain terms to charge them with Schiſm, and the Terms of Communion offer'd, did imply Submiſſion to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by conſequence to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them. But the utmoſt that could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from them, was only that they would take farther Advice, and give another Meeting with a greater Number. And then were preſent ſeven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and many learned Men, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Monaſtery of <hi>Banchor,</hi> where <hi>Dinoth</hi> was then Abbot; and the reſult of this Meeting was, that they utterly refuſed Submiſſion to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as Arch-biſhop over them.</q> So far our Author obſerving that the Truth of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory did not only depend upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Bede,</hi> but likewiſe upon the Authority of a Manuſcript ſet forth by <hi>Spelman,</hi> in which <hi>Dinoth</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Banchor</hi> is reported to have ſaid, that he knew not who that Pope was whom they called Father of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Patrem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</note> to whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have the <hi>Britiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> pay Obedience. And although he confeſſes that this Manuſcript was by ſome judg'd to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious, yet he brings <hi>Spelman</hi>'s Authority for it; <note place="margin">Pag. 360. <hi>Ex Tomo</hi> 1. <hi>Conciliorum</hi> Spelmanni.</note>
                  <q>who, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> ſets it down at large in <hi>Welch, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> tells from whom he had it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tranſcribed it, and that it appeared to him to have been an old Manuſcript, taken out of an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47567:64"/>older, but without Date or Author, and believes it to be ſtill in the <hi>Cotton</hi> Library. Here is all the appearance of Ingenuity and Faithfulneſs that can be expected, and he was a Perſon of too great Judgment and Sagacity to be eaſily impoſed upon by a Modern Invention, or a new found Schedule, as Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> phraſes it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. It may be eaſily collected from theſe Words of the Author, that although he makes uſe of <hi>Bede</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the chief ſupport of his Cauſe, yet he doth not deny the Authority of the Manuſcript ſet forth by <hi>Spelman,</hi> which ought to be rejected as a modern Invention, as may eaſily be ſhewn. For it is not at all probable, that <hi>Dinoth</hi> Abbot of <hi>Banchor</hi> ſhould ſpeak thoſe things concerning the Power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he is reported to have done in that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript: For the Pope's Authority was no News to the <hi>Britiſh Iſlands.</hi> Neither was the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> Patriarchal Authority over the <hi>Britiſh Churches</hi> any modern Invention. Whoever ſhall peruſe the ancient Records of the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> will, as I ſuppoſe, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find theſe things are not to be denied. For if they had been new, and lately invented, why then ſhould <hi>Eborius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>York, Reſtitutus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London, Adelphus</hi> Biſhop of the<note n="*" place="margin">Coloniae Londinenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> 
                  <hi>London Colony,</hi> and others of the <hi>Britiſh Clergy,</hi> being preſent in the Council of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> at the beginning of the fourth Age, have ſent the Acts of that Council to <hi>Sylvester,</hi> that he might pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them to all?<note place="margin">Patres <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latenſes</hi> epiſt.

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:47567:64"/>
               <p>3. It is manifeſt, that about the middle of the ſame Age, the Britiſh Biſhops, who, as St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, were preſent at the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> oppoſed the <hi>Euſebians,</hi> and contended that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was rightly abſolved by <hi>Julius</hi> the Firſt; that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Appeals to be made to the Apoſtolic See, from all Provinces of the Chriſtian World, and that they declared <hi>the Memory of</hi> Peter <hi>the Apostle was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd</hi> in the Roman Biſhop. For ſo the Britiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who together with the three hundred Biſhops aſſembled at the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> [<hi>Canon</hi> 3.] have decreed: <hi>Let us honour the Memory of St.</hi> Peter <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi>

The acts teſtifie, that the <hi>Britains</hi> contended about Traditions, which they prefer'd before all Churches, which agree amongſt themſelves in Chriſt over the world, ſo that if the queſtion was, concerning the Primacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is manifeſt that all the Churches in the World did then ackowledge the Primacy of <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor; as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great alſo teſtifies,<note place="margin">Gregorius Magnus <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 32. <hi>Vid. num.</hi> LII.</note> [<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 32.] writing to <hi>Mauritius: For 'tis manifest</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to all that knowthe Goſpel, that the care of the whole Church was by the word of our Lord committed to</hi> S.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47567:70"/>againſt the judgment of the whole Catholic World. Suppoſing therefore that the <hi>Britains,</hi> amongſt other Traditions, rejected alſo that of the Primacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop; what could be gather'd from hence, but that, as <hi>Baronius</hi> the Parent of <hi>Annals</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, after the <hi>Saxons</hi> had broken in upon them, they deſerted the Doctrines and Rites of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, and receded as Schiſmatics from the center of Eccleſiaſtical Communion? What elſe can we conclude but that God was willing to ſhew the falſhood of the Schiſmatical Church of <hi>Britain</hi> by the Miracle which he wrought upon <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion? Do not the Acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Synod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Bede</hi> teſtifie, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did by ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a Miracle demonſtrate the truth of thoſe things which he propoſed to the <hi>Britains,</hi> that they were forc'd to confeſs it was the true way of Juſtice which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Preach'd? If theſe things cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as it is moſt certain they cannot, what do the modern <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors mean, when they object againſt Catholics the anſwer of the <hi>Britains</hi> and the Monks of <hi>Banchor?</hi> Will they not at length be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that they oppoſe nothing but their own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which are the vain Forgeries of Men, againſt that Truth which hath been confirm'd by a Divine Teſtimony; and that the reſt of the Church hath juſt reaſon to condemn them for having loſt both Truth and Modeſty at the ſame time? I am weary of vainly ſpending my time in matters ſo clear, ſo manifeſt, ſo perſpicuous; and of being again forc'd, when Religion is the ſubject, to bring a new Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that Truth, which all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers of former Ages, all men that have been eminent in <hi>Britain</hi> for Sanctity and Learning, and laſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <hi>You cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> ſaith he, in the place above cited, <hi>but that you know, that the Epiſcopal See of the City of</hi> Rome <hi>was granted to</hi> Peter <hi>as the Chief; in which,</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>the Head of all the Apoſtles ſate, from whence he was called</hi> Cephas; <hi>in which one See Unity was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by all, leaſt the reſt of the Apoſtles ſhould claim a Superiority to any of their Sees: So that now he would be a Schiſmatic and a Sinner, who ſhould ſet up another See in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this peculiar See. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this one See only, which is its chief Dowry,</hi> Peter <hi>firſt ſate, to whom</hi> Linus <hi>ſucceeded;</hi> and ſo reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a long Series of Roman Biſhops, till he came to <hi>Siricius,</hi> (in whoſe time he wrote) <hi>who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Biſhop, with whom the whole World agrees as we do, in one Society of Communion, by intercourſe of Communicatory Letters.</hi> There was then a true Church in time paſt, which diffuſed throughout the whole World, made <hi>Peter</hi>'s one See the Center of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; and communicated with the Roman Church, as a Sign of one Faith and Religion, by Communicatory Letters.

               <hi>But it cannot be denied,</hi> ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth at that time, <hi>but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church of the Faithful owns and reverences the Holy See of</hi> Rome <hi>as their Mother and Primate.</hi> If every Church did allow of this in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, if they all recognized this one See of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> what Reaſon, what Right, what Equity could this very <hi>Henry,</hi> the First, of all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have to ſet up another See againſt this peculiar See, and offer to reſtrain the Bounds of its Primacy? I know indeed that your Author, against whom I have hitherto written, hath made the ſame Anſwer to this, that <hi>Luther</hi> did in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; that the Pope had not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Power ſo great, and of ſo large an Extent as this, by the Command of God, or by the Conſent of Men, but had uſurped it to himſelf. But becauſe he agrees with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in oppoſing the Popes Power, it is but reaſonable he ſhould hear what Anſwer <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth hath made to him in the Perſon of <hi>Luther: I would have him to tell me when it was that he enter'd forcibly upon this large Poſſeſſion? The firſt beginnings of ſo immenſe a Power could not have been unknown to us, eſpecially if they had happened within the Memory of Man. But if he ſhall ſay that it is an Age or two ſince the thing was done, let him give us an account of it from Hiſtory. Or elſe, if it be ſo ancient, that the Original of it, although it be ſo conſiderable a Matter, is obliterated; he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47567:73"/>knows it is the wiſe Proviſion of all Laws, that when the Right to any thing is ſo far beyond the Memory of Man, that it cannot be known what a beginning it had, it ſhould be preſumed to have had legitimate one; and it is plainly forbidden by the conſent of all Nations, that thoſe things ſhould be unſetled, which have for a long time continued in a ſetled State—I very much admire how he could ever hope to find Readers either ſo credulous or ſo ſtupid as to believe an unarmed Prieſt, all alone, having no Guard to attend him, no juſt Right to ſupport him, nor Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to rely upon, could ſo much as hope ever to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo great a Dominion over ſo many Biſhops that were his Equals, in ſo many different and far diſtant Countries. Much leſs can any one believe, that all People, Cities, Kingdoms and Provinces, were ſo prodigal of their Concerns, Rights and Liberties, as to give a Prieſt, that was a Stranger to them, and to whom they owed nothing, ſo great a Power over them, as he could ſcarce dare to wiſh for.</hi> Theſe things are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and the more remarkable, becauſe written by that King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> under whom your Engliſh Church ſeparated from the Roman, for a Reaſon which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to relate, neither is it fitting for you to hear it; and contrary to the perpetual Tradition of the Ancients, contrary to the Faith of your Ancestors, contrary to the Conſent of all Catholics, broke into open Schiſm, and fell from Schiſm into Hereſie, and from Hereſie into the Abyſs of thoſe Errors which are now freſh in the Memory of Men, and which Poſterity will ever have cauſe to lament. Of theſe Errors I need not make a Catalogue, or produce any Testimony, ſince you are too well acquainted with them; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhould indeed think my Pains very well beſtowed, if
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47567:73"/>I could by any means recal you from Hereſie and Schiſm, which are the Sourſes of ſo many Evils, to a ſound Mind, and move you to repent whilſt you have time.</p>
            <p>After the Darkneſs of Schiſm, the Light of Truth ſhone forth to you under the Reign of <hi>Mary</hi> your Queen, which <hi>Britain</hi> calling to mind its ancient Faith, receiv'd with due Veneration. After the Night of Hereſies, into which <hi>Britain</hi> fell back under the Reign of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Faith like the Morning ſeems to riſe again, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Catholic Prince; whence we may hope the Light of Truth, which your Anceſtors enjoyed for ſo many Ages, will break forth among you into open Day, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that Place from whence a hundred Years ſince it was forced into Baniſhment. This is what all thoſe Churches, with whom you have formerly held Communion, earneſtly deſire. This is what <hi>Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Bohemia, Poland, Dalmatia, Italy, Sicily,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſtern Regions, in which the ancient Religion now flouriſhes with ſo much Splendor, continually pray for. This is what the Churches, ſtill remaining in <hi>Grece, Aſia, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, Meſopotamia, Perſia, Armenia,</hi> and all the East, will joyfully entertain. This the vaſt Provinces of the new World, inhabited by ſo many People, ſo many Nations, ſo many Families: This the far diſtant Inhabitants of <hi>China,</hi> many of which, have in the former, and in this preſent Age, embraced the Chriſtian Faith: This innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Iſlands, ſcattered every where up and down in that Sea we call the ocean, will receive with joyful Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This will be moſt acceptable to <hi>Rome</hi> the Mother Church, which firſt brought you forth to God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither could any thing be more delightful to Her, than to receive You, as a kind Parent, amongſt ſo many others which at this time are returning to Her from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Schiſm, and cheriſh you in her Boſom. All the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47567:74"/>other above mention'd Churches throughout the World, are ſubject to this Roman See, and all theſe joyn'd together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Catholic Church, from which none can be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who deſires to be one of the Faithful, and would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation. Would to God therefore that you would look after the Salvation of your own Souls, whilſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church ſpread over the Face of the whole Earth, waits earneſily for your Converſion; that you would return to the Communion of that Church, out of which there is no Salvation.<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. c. <hi>5.</hi>
